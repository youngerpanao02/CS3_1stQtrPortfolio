# Younger's Reflection
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. **Operators.** I have learned and understood a wide variety of lessons in the scope of Computer Science this quarter. I first learned about the operators--not really the basics since we have already learned that in FYP--but more thorough and deep. There were some concepts which I found new and very much confusing since I was deeply rooted with C++. 

2. **The Interior/Structure of VSCode.** The second lesson I learned was, of course, the interior and structure of VSCode and Javascript itself. I put this as my second since I got to master using VSCode only after we discussed operators. The structure of VSCode was a bit similar to CodeBlocks and Python; a lot of terms and concepts in Python and C++ was integrated in VSCode, and that really helped me a lot. There were also some VSCode signs that had the same function with some in Python and C++, but different symbls are used. 

3. **Generating Outputs.** Third and fourth concept I learned was the different types of generating outputs in VSCode and Javascript. I got used to C++'s "cout<<" statement, which immediately gives us the output of the code. For VSCode, there were a variety on how to show the output, so I got confused at first at which is to be used in my codes, but I eventually got the hang of it.

4. **Conditional Statements.** The fifth concept I learned--well, developed knowlegde more about, was the conept of Conditional Statements. In 8th grade, I was actually so confused on these concepts, especially on loop. I did not know what type of loop is to be used, either while, for, and so on. This quarter gave me the opportunity to further hone my skills in integrating these concepts onto my code. Although I cannot fully say that I've already mastered it, it was so fun learning this concept.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **Integrating Functions.** Integrating outputs was the last concept I've learned. I really can't say anything about this, since I am still learing how to get the hang of using it, although it is very interesting. We also had functions last year in C++, in which, unfortunately, I did not really understand.
2. I do not have anything to say for the other topics, as I know that I can work on them properly, and that I have no problem with them.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. **PRACTICE!!!!** I really believe that in order to fully understand and master these concepts and terms, I must practice more by creating codes (that work, obviously).
2. **RESEARCH!!!** I should also research on these concepts whenever I get confused. In the past, I just leave them out in the air, so I don't really learn anything.
3. **CONSULT!!!** I should also consult with Ma'am Aline about some concepts I don't really understand (if research doesn't suffice).
4. **GET CONMFORTABLE!!!** Currently, I am still a bit uncomfortable with coding in VSCode. I believe that with doing all of what was mentioned above, I would get myself comfortable in class and at home. Furthermore, there will be high chances that I'll ace my coding tests.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. **Effective - PARTICIPATION** I believe that participating in discussions are a neccessity as well as an advantage for myself, because you get the opportunity to answer and recite, as well as ask questionws about some concepts you don't really understand.
2. **Effective - In-class coding sessions** In connection to the one stated above, in-class coding sessions were also helpful since I get to code in front of Ma'am Aline, and ask her whether my code is correct, or ask her the reason why my code's not working. Either way, Ma'am Aline is the GOAT of CS3 (oh, and also Sir Roy)!!!
3. **Ineffective - Practical Tests** I know that practical tests are a requirement for grading, and I understand how serious this test is. However, this also challenges the mental capability of students to actually code, given the conditions of time limit and peer pressure (may nauunang matapos), which results to giving up, not even getting a full score.
4. **Ineffective - Coding Tasks** Since I am still adjusting to VSCode, I don't really know what to do. This results me in working on the coding tasks for for than 2 hours, for the sake of getting full points.
